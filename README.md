# Maplet

A Maplet that stores **locations**. Maplet caters to individuals that are planning to go overseas
or are frequent travellers.

Maplet can store important information on locations such as:
1. opening hours
2. price 
3. travel time etc.

This project is based on the AddressBook-Level3 project created by the [SE-EDU initiative](https://se-education.org).

## MVP Features
- [ ] Add Location
- [ ] Delete location
- [ ] List one location
- [ ] List all locations


  Example usages:
  * trip planner
  * Storing locations of interest

* The project is based on an ongoing software project for a desktop application (called _Maplet_) used for managing contact details.
  * It is **written in OOP fashion**. It provides a **reasonably well-written** code base **bigger** (around 6 KLoC) than what students usually write in beginner-level SE modules, without being overwhelmingly big.
  * It comes with a **reasonable level of user and developer documentation**.


* For the detailed documentation of this project, see the **[Maplet Product Website](ay2526s1-cs2103t-w12-1.github.io/tp/)**.
* This project is a **part of the se-education.org** initiative. If you would like to contribute code to this project, see [se-education.org](https://se-education.org/#contributing-to-se-edu) for more info.
